# About 

Starting Fall 2019 I will join [Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science](https://www.cis.rit.edu/) at [Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](https://www.rit.edu/) as an Imaging Science PhD Student! 

In 2015, I earned a B.S. in Mechatronics Engineering from  [Universidad Nacional de Ingenier√≠a](https://www.uni.edu.pe/) in Lima, Peru. Subsequently, I worked at [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/) as a research assistant under the supervision of [Mathias Wolf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthias-wolf-08b88b/) in Pennsylvania from 2017 to 2018. Currently I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer focused on computer vision problems at [Everis](https://www.everis.com/Peru/es/home-peru) in Lima, Peru. 

My research interest is focused on computer vision and how machine learning techniques could potentially reason about the visual world.
