# About 

Starting Fall 2019 I will join [Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science](https://www.cis.rit.edu/) at [Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](https://www.rit.edu/) as an Imaging Science PhD Student! 

I earned a B.S. in Mechatronics Engineering at [Universidad Nacional de Ingenier√≠a, Lima, Peru](https://www.uni.edu.pe/) in 2015. Subsequently, I worked at [Siemens Healthineers, Malvern, Pennsylvania](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/), as a research assistant under the supervision of [Mathias Wolf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthias-wolf-08b88b/) in 2017. 

My research interest is focused on computer vision and how machine learning techniques could potentially reason about the visual world.
